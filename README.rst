About
=====

RDRF ( Rare Disease Registry Framework ) is a tool for 
the creation of web-based data entry forms and questionnaires based
on reusable data element definitions ( "Common Data Elements" ) which
can be created and/or loaded into the system at runtime without changes
to the source code. RDRF has been developed at the `Centre of Comparative
Genomics <http://ccg.murdoch.edu.au>`_
